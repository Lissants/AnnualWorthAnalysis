<h1>Annual-Equivalent Worth Analysis</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
This Java program is made to calculate the Annual-Equivalent Worth Analysis for my university project in Engineering Economics course.</br>
<h2>Definition</h2>
Annual-Equivalent Worth Analysis is the sum of all the revenue and costs over the course of a year (annually).</br>
Annual-Equivalent Worth Analysis is also the most-used technique to evaluate and compare investments options in corporate settings.</br>
<h2>Formula</h2>
This Analysis uses five variables which are:
<ul>
  <li><strong>P</strong>, which represents Present worth, value, or amount</li>
  <li><strong>F</strong>, which represents Future worth, value, or amount</li>
  <li><strong>A</strong>, which represents the Uniform amount per interest period</li>
  <li><strong>i</strong>, which represents the Discount rate</li>
  <li><strong>N</strong>, which represents the Number of compounding periods; or the expected life of an assets</li>
</ul>
<h2>Case Example</h2>
A firm has three investments proposals available.

The firm has a Minimum Acceptable Rate of Return (MARR) of 1.53095% per month.
<br/>Using the Annual Worth Analysis:
<ol>
  <li>Determine the preferred proposal</li>
  <li>If the projects are independent, which of them should be selected?</li>
</ol>

Hence, among all three proposals, Proposal B should be preferred since it offers the largest Annual Worth value numerically.
<br/>And if all the projects are independent, all of the proposals should be selected since all of them have annual worth value greater than zero.
<h2>Program Implementation</h2>
The program is made to automate the calculation for the required analysis.
</br>The preferred output is as such:
